# Stateless (in draft state)

“A person who is not considered as a national by any State under the operation of its law” – The international legal definition of a stateless person
There are an [estimated 12 million stateless peoples globally](https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/11/1025561), according to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR). Modern examples of statelessness include the Rohingya, Palestinaians, Kurds, and more. War, famine, climate change, occupation, ethnic cleansing and more, all cause stateless. Stateless is a human made problem that borders and nation states perpetuate.

"Stateless" is a social media solution aimed to help address the problems that stateless people face. It does so by offering the possability to establish:
  - individual and collective digital identity
  - network
  - build community
  - send remittances
  - exchange socially valuable services
  - access support
  - fight corruption and abuse of human rights.

Most of all, Stateless aims to support the dignity and lives of all people irrespective of state recognition and borders.
